## About

SongSortingHat is a passion project I've been developing off and on for the past couple years, with the aim of merging music taste and social media in an easy, light-weight form. 

The core function started originally as a website to make it easy for music fans create top ten songs lists for specific artists; I was inspired by a website that was popular many years ago where a user was given a series of questions to help them narrow down their favorite pokemon. I wanted to bring this algorithm to music, as over the years, I've loved making top ten lists for music discographies but found it to be annoying and cumbersome to actually go about doing it. 

Although this was the spark for SongSortingHat, I wanted to take it to the next step and turn it into a full on social media platform that centralizes music taste for users while allowing music fans to explore music tastes of not only global communities, but communities around them, such as colleges, friend groups, and more!

My goal for this website is to be the ultimate one-stop-shop for music taste and discovery!
